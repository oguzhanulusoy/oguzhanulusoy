ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @oguzhanulusoy
<p>I have a MS and a BS in computer science and engineering. I'm interested in software development since 2012. I'm experienced in developing both frontend and backend systems. I've been working as a software engineer for 5+ years.</p>
<p>I'm currently working for Orion, in Istanbul. Since we're building a huge Telco product, I have chance to work on different fields that are OAM (mostly), call processing, database and platform. I'm being sometimes involved to CI pipeline processes. I'm also responsible of a group of servers to deploy, configure and schedule. Hereby, I'm skilled in containerization and motivated at advanced networking, except coding.</p>
<p>Before joining Orion, I worked as full-stack for R&D center of university I had graduated. This R&D center was dedicated to develop new student information system as a commercial product. I architectured the system and contributed to development.</p>

<p>ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software architecture and design.</p>
